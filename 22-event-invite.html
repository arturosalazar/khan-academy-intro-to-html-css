<!--
  In this project, you'll make an event invite for an event- a party, a workshop, a wedding, whatever you want. It should have
  event title, details, and maybe it'd have a guest list or RSVP button.

  Before you start coding, I encourage you to "prototype" it - to plan it out either on paper or with a "prototyping" tool.
  Sketch out the vision you have in your head and go through a few prototypes until you're happy.

  Then, when you're ready, try to implement your event invite in HTML/CSS. If you get stuck on something that's hard to 
  transfer from paper to HTML, try searching on the internet or clicking "Request Help." I bet you'll learn something from the 
  process.
  
  Requirements:
    - Must contain some sort of event details
    - Must use at least 6 differnet HTML tags
    - Must have at least 3 CSS Rules
    - Must use at least 4 different CSS properties
    - Must not have any errors or bad practices
