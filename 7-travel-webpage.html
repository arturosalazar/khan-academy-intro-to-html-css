<!-- 
  In this project, you'll use everything you've learned so far to create a travel website enticing viewers to visit
  an exotic locale. 
  You should have images of what they'll see, lists of things to see and places to go, and paragraphs of enticing details. 
  You should also use CSS to style the website, using a mix of the simple selectors you've learned.
