/*
  This is a webpage about animal group names, with a few headings and images as examples.

  There are already 2 CSS rules to style the <h1>s - one with a pseudo selector, and one without. Add another selector to
  each of the rules, so that they also style <h2>s.

        <h1>Animal group names</h1>
        
        <p>For many species of animals, there are names that we use to refer to a group of them - like a flock of birds. Here are a few you might not know.</p>
        
        <h2>A skulk of foxes</h2>

        <p>Also called a "leash."</p>
