        <h2>The Dog</h2>
        <p>The <em>coolest</em> creature by far is the man's best friend, the <strong>Dog</strong>. Dogs are wonderful because they are <strong>kind and <em>loyal</em></strong>. A dog will always be excited to see you whether it has been one year or one minute since they've seen you.</p>
